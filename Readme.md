# Notice 
If GitHub fails to render the notebook, then use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Instructions: try to open the notebook in GitHub, copy the link and paste it in the address field of nbviewer.

# Introduction

Jan 2019: initial upload of some preliminary material. Expect more material to be added and the structure to be reshuffled.

Julia code for a Financial Econometrics (MSc) course at UNISG. 

The current version is tested on Julia 1.0, but should work also on 0.7.

The code does not use any specialized econometrics packages, just general purpose packages (plotting, optimization, distributions,...). I believe that improves the learning of econometric methods.

The .ipynb files are Julia notebooks. They use data in the Data folder and Julia functions in the jlFiles folder. The notebooks are meant to be used together with my lecture notes (the pdf file).


# Instructions

If you just want to see a notebook, click on it.  Sometimes it renders better if you activate the nbviewer (see the symbol in the upper right corner once you have opened the file).

You use IJulia to edit and run these Julia notebooks. You can either install Julia/IJulia on your local computer (see https://sites.google.com/site/paulsoderlindecon/home/software for instructions) or use www.JuliaBox.com. 

IJulia and JuliaBox allow you to convert the notebooks to jl files ("File-Download As-")
